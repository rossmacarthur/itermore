# iterchunks

[![Crates.io Version](https://badgers.space/crates/version/iterchunks)](https://crates.io/crates/iterchunks)
[![Docs.rs Latest](https://badgers.space/badge/docs.rs/latest/blue)](https://docs.rs/iterchunks)
[![Build Status](https://badgers.space/github/checks/rossmacarthur/itermore?label=build)](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/itermore/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

This crate provides an iterator adapter that yields N elements of the
iterator at a time.

### Deprecated

This crate is deprecated in favour of the `itermore` crate and it
currently just re-exports types from there. The following dependency
definition is the equivalent of using this crate.

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
itermore = { version = "...", default-features = false, features = ["array_chunks"] }
```

## Getting started

Add the crate to your Cargo manifest.

```sh
cargo add iterchunks
```

And bring the `IterArrayChunks` trait into scope.

```rust
use iterchunks::IterArrayChunks;
```

Now you can use the [`array_chunks`] method on any iterator.

```rust
for [a, b, c] in iter.array_chunks() {
    println!("{} {} {}", a, b, c)
}
```

Generally the size of `N` can be inferred by the compiler but you can also
specify it manually.

```rust
let c = iter.array_chunks::<3>();
```

[`array_chunks`]: IterArrayChunks::array_chunks
